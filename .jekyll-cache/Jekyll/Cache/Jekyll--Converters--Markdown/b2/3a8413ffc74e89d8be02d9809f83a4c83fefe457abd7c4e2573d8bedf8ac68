I"Á<p>I am currently building (and writing this on) my custom built blogging CMS. I plan to make this open source with a paid service for companies to use. Itâ€™s a bare-bones CMS that covers the basics of simple bloggersâ€™ needs. And since itâ€™s built with Firebase, the overhead costs will be minimal. The repo is currently private, but I plan to open the source code when I feel good about it being a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage. Please email me if you would like more details.</p>
