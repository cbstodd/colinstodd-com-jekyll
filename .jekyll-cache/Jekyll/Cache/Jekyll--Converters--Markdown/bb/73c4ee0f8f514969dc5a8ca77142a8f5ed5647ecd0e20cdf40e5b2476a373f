I"å<p>My time at the <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frm1st.aspx?tab=home" target="_blank">Maryland General Assembly</a> has come to an end.  As much as I have enjoyed working with the people and politics I am honored to say that I have accepted a position with the <a href="http://www.gastro.org/" target="_blank">American Gastroenterological Association</a> in Bethesda MD.  I will be the back-end web developer, and could not be more excited about this new opportunity!</p>
