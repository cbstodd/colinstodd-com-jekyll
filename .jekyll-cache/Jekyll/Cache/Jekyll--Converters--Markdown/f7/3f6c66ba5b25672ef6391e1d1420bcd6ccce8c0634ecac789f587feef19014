I"Ö<p>People often ask me about the applications I use for software development, so Iâ€™ve decided to create a list of my favorite Mac OSX applications. Many of these apps are development tools but others help me outside of software development.  This list is specifically for MAC OSX, but most of them are cross-platform and can be used on Windows, Linux, iOS and Android. The list is in no particular order, and I want to note that none of these companies have asked for my endorsement, but I might have affiliate links which are marked with a  <code class="highlighter-rouge">ğŸ‘ğŸ¼</code>  however, those links mean nothing in my support for or against them. Iâ€™m just trying to offset the costs of hosting this site.</p>
