<p class="8u$">If you landed on this page I assume you have some interest in who I am. And since I’m not cool enough (yet) to have my own Wikipedia page, I’ll share this bit on my personal site.</p>

<p class="8u$">In short, I’m a percussion player turned web application developer. In 2014 I moved from my hometown of Annapolis Maryland to work in the D.C. area with the <a href="https://www.gastro.org" target="_blank">American Gastroenterological Association</a>.</p>

<p>Other than writing software, my other passion in life is music. I played music with two bands (“<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/dead-city-radio/346165288" target="_blank">Earthtone</a>” and “<a href="https://damnrightmusic.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Damn Right!</a>”) for about 10 years. I then made a drastic switch to the <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frm1st.aspx?tab=home" target="_blank">Maryland General Assembly</a>. While working at the MGA I began teaching myself to program using online resources, but I quickly realized that I was in-over-my-head and decided to get some formal education; Which led me to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>. In August of 2014 I completed a boot camp course at <a href="https://betamore.com/en" target="_blank">Betamore Academy</a> in Baltimore Maryland which helped me land my first development job with the AGA.</p>

<p>At the AGA I spend most of my time working with the “Full Stack”, and a focus on using front-end frameworks such as <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a>, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">ExpressJS</a> (MEAN stack) and much of the common tooling out there for NodeJS; and I almost always use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> as my foundation.</p>

<p>That “H” logo is the logo for <a href="https://harpua.co/" target="_blank" title="Harpua, LLC">Harpua, LLC</a>, which I co-founded with a great developer friend of mine. If you see something with “Colper”, that’s a nickname that I’ve had since I was young…</p>
