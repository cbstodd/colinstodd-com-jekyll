I"[<p>My time at the Maryland General Assembly has come to an end.  As much as I have enjoyed working with the people and politics I am honored to say that I have accepted a position with the American Gastroenterological Association in Bethesda MD.  I will be the back-end web developer, and could not be more excited about this new opportunity!</p>
