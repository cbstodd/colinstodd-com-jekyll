I"Š	<p>Angular 7 is out and its latest iteration has some differences (good ones) from its earlier candidates. It hasnâ€™t been out very long so itâ€™s hard to find updated tutorials on the web.</p>

<p>Here is an ongoing list of free resources for beginners. Iâ€™ll add more as I find good ones, but If you know of something let me know and Iâ€™ll add it to the list.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular Docs</a> has a <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tutorial</a> on there, which covers the entire framework. Itâ€™s extremely in depth, but can be a difficult read for beginners. I suggest coming back to this once you have built a basic app or two (A deeper dive).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb/playlists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traversy Media Channel on Youtube</a>. This guy covers just about all the awesomeness associated with Angular (Firebase, observables, etc). Heâ€™s a down-to-earth, self taught guy (should watch his new videos on his story. Itâ€™s inspiring for those less fortunate). The link I provided takes you to his playlist channel. Heâ€™s doing awesome things with education for beginners. Follow him!</p>

    <p>I think this guy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCTVrRB5KpIiK6V2GGVsR1Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kudvenkat</a> from YouTube explains things the best (IMHO). He just started releasing his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWQZCDegWHg&amp;feature=em-subs_digest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular 2+ videos</a>, so the series may be incomplete. But he is my favorite (when I was learning ng1), so I can only imagine it being the same with this series. Check the reviews on youtube if you dont believe me. Its a bit dry, but the way he teaches seems to have it stick in my head. Canâ€™t really explain it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://egghead.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">egghead.io</a>, but I feel like he rushes through his tutorials.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And if you feel like spending 10 bucks or so, I highly recommend <a href="https://udemy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Udemy</a> Videos. If the videos are not on sale at $10-15, you can find coupons online or wait until they are. Sales happen seemingly every month. Let me know if you have any questions!</p>
