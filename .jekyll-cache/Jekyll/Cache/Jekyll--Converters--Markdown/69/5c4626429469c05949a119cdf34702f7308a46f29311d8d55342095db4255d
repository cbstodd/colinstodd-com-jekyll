I"<p>Maybe it’s because I’m a web developer, but people often ask me about the applications I use, so I’ve decided to create a list of my favorite Mac OSX applications. Many of these are development tools, and nearly all of them have become apps that I would find difficult to live without. This list is in no particular order, and none of them have asked for my endorsement, nor are any of these links part of an affiliate program. I just wanted to share the tools that help keep me productive and organized.</p>
