I"Û<p>Iâ€™ve started learning <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flutter</a>, which is a framework for building mobile (but now also <a href="https://flutter.dev/web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web</a>) apps on both iOS and Android devices using the same codebase. Iâ€™ll let you do the research on <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flutter</a> but if you landed on this page, thereâ€™s probably a good chance you already know about <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flutter</a>. Nevertheless, below is a function to help you â€œpretty-printâ€ JSON data into your <a href="https://dart.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dart</a> terminal.</p>
