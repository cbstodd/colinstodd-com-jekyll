I"/<p>If you haven’t heard, Mr. Trump and the Republican Congress have just passed a resolution which allows internet service providers to sell sensitive consumer data, such as browsing history without their permission. In short this means that you have less privacy than you once did.</p>

<p>Stuff like this really eeks me. It’s not that I have anything to hide, it’s just that something doesnt feel right when people are so egar to spend billions on something I’m doing. I haven’t put my finger on it, so I’ll save that for a later post.  But because of laws like this, I feel it is even more important to be careful with how I use the internet.</p>

<p>I think Chrome is the best browser out there, but it’s the worst when it comes to your privacy. Google makes a good portion of their money from your online behavior, which is what sent me to Opera.  Opera is built with much of the same technologies (Webkit) as Chrome and they both perform really well. However, Opera is a bit more considerate when it comes to your privacy, and I love the tools that Opera is bringing to the table.  Its a great browser, but it would be even better with Chrome extentions, and that is why I’m writing this post.</p>

<p>You can do so by downloading this <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/?display=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Opera plugin</a>. Once you install the plugin, you can then search the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chrome extension store</a> from your Opera browser to install. It will walk you through the steps as seen in the image below.</p>
