I"Á<p>I recently upgraded my MAC operating system from <a href="https://support.apple.com/macos/mojave" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mojave</a> to <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catalina</a>, all went well but I noticed that my text editor fonts were looking thinner than normal. I recall this happening with the <a href="https://support.apple.com/macos/mojave" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mojave</a> update, so I sort of knew where to begin looking, but I couldnâ€™t find exactly what I needed in one spot so Iâ€™m going to post it here.  <strong><em>I am by no means an expert on these commands, Iâ€™m just posting what worked for me</em></strong>.</p>
