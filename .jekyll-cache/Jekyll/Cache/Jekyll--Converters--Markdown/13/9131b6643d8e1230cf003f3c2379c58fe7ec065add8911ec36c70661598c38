I"ƒ<p>People often ask me about the applications I use for software development, so Iâ€™ve decided to create a list of my favorite Mac OSX applications. Many of these apps are development tools but others help me outside of software development.  This list is specifically for MAC OSX, but most of them are cross-platform and can be used on Windows, Linux, iOS and Android. The list is in no particular order, and I want to note that none of these companies have asked for my endorsement, nor are any of these links part of an affiliate program. I just wanted to share some of the tools that help keep my crazy life productive and organized.</p>
