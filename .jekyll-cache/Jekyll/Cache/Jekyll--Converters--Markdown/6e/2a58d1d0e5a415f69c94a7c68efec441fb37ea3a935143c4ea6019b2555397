I"ƒ<p>If you landed on this page I assume you have some interest in who I am. And since Iâ€™m not cool enough (yet) to have my own Wikipedia page, Iâ€™ll share this bit on my personal site.</p>

<p>In short, Iâ€™m a percussion player turned web application developer. In 2014 I moved from my hometown of Annapolis Maryland to work in the D.C. area with the <a href="https://www.gastro.org" target="_blank">American Gastroenterological Association</a>.</p>

<p>Other than writing software, my other passion in life is music. I played music with two bands [â€œ<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/dead-city-radio/346165288" target="_blank">Earthtone</a>â€ and â€œDamn Right!â€] for about 10 years. I then made a drastic switch to the Maryland General Assembly. While working at the MGA I began teaching myself to program using online resources, but I quickly realized that I was in-over-my-head and decided to get some formal education; Which led me to Ruby and Ruby on Rails. In August of 2014 I completed a boot camp course at Betamore Academy in Baltimore Maryland which helped me land my first development job with the AGA.</p>

<p>At the AGA I spend most of my time working with the â€œFull Stackâ€, and a focus on using front-end frameworks such as AngularJS, Angular (LOVE AngularFire2), React, TypeScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS (MEAN stack) and much of the common tooling out there for NodeJS; and I almost always use Bootstrap as my foundation.</p>

<p>That â€œHâ€ logo is the logo for Harpua, LLC, which I co-founded with a great developer friend of mine. If you see something with â€œColperâ€, thatâ€™s a nickname that Iâ€™ve had since I was youngâ€¦</p>
