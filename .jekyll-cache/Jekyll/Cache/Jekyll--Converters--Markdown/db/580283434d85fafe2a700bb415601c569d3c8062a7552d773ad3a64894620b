I"¢<p>For just about all of my Angular applications I‚Äôve used Real Favicon Generator to generate the files for my Favicon icon. It‚Äôs a great tool, and I highly suggest using it and donating to it. However, their guide only shows you how to add your favicon to a Node or HTML5 application/site. If you are using Angular there are a few more steps involved, so I‚Äôve found a quick and painless way to use both the Node and HTML5 tools. I‚Äôll also show you how to add Progressive Web App (PWA) meta tags so that you can add your newly created icons to your mobile homescreen. Lets get to it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Head over to the Real Favicon Generator site and upload your icon. Note that your icon should have even/square dimensions and be at least 260px wide/high.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set your icon settings; which basically allows you to play with the margin size, background size and what it will look like as a PWA icon on your mobile devices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the Real Favicon generator does its thing, you‚Äôll want to click on the ‚ÄúNodeJS‚Äù tab as seen in the image below.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
