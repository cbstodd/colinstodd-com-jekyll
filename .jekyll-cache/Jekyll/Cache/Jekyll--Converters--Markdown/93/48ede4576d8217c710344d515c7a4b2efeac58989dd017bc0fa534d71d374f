I"<p>This is my latest pride and joy as a PWA (Progressive Web Application). Itâ€™s a gift wishlist slanted as a social network. As of now itâ€™s not a store, rather, a fancy gift-list creator. Itâ€™s still in itâ€™s infancy but I feel itâ€™s reached itâ€™s MVP level, and I plan to incorporate popular online store APIâ€™s, features, and possibly a browser extension.</p>

<p>The app was built with Angular 5, Bootstrap 4.beta, Firebase (AngularFire API), Angular Material Design, and is hosted on Googleâ€™s Cloud Platform via Firebase Hosting.</p>
