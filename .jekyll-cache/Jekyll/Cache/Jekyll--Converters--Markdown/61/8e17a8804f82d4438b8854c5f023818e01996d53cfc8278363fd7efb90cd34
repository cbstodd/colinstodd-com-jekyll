I"·<p>I built a custom CMS (Later named to DolphinCMS) using Angular 6, Firebase (AngularFire), Bootstrap 4, ngx-bootstrap, Angular Material Design, Robotron (Serverside rendering), and more. The site will be visited by tens of thousands of people, with over a dozen active CMS users. I built 99% of the site. I received some help with CSS as a result to meeting a deadline. The CMS uses Roboton for serverside rendering (SEO, Graph QL).</p>
