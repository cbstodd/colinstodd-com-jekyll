I"-<p>So I recently upgraded my MAC operating system from <a href="https://support.apple.com/macos/mojave" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mojave</a> to <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catalina</a>, all went well but I noticed that my text editor fonts were looking thinner than normal. I recall this happening with the <a href="https://support.apple.com/macos/mojave" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mojave</a> update, so I sort of knew where to begin looking, but I couldnâ€™t find exactly what I needed in one spot so Iâ€™m going to post it here.  <strong><em>I am by no means an expert on these commands, Iâ€™m just posting what worked for me</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Many people had to play with these settings because not every external display is the same, so what Iâ€™ve posted here might not fit your setup exactly. It took some trial and error, but hopefully these commands will help you. As youâ€™ll see below, everything can be reverted (<a href="#revert">see the bottom of the page</a>) and the commands wont do any serous damage to your MAC.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note: That after every time you run these commands, youâ€™ll have to log out of your computer and log back in for it to take effect (sucks, but true). You can do so by pressing</em></strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">command</code> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">shift</code> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">Q</code>.</p>

<h3 id="first">First:</h3>
<p>Youâ€™ll want to note if you have your font smoothing enabled or disabled in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Settings</code> &gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">General</code> tab as seen in the image. This also plays a roleâ€¦ I turned mine off.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="8u$">
    <img src="../../images/posts/font_smoothing_toggle_min.png" class="image fit" title="font smoothing osx catalina" />
  </div>
</div>

<p>And then you can turn off font smoothing for system wide:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>defaults write <span class="nt">-g</span> CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled <span class="nt">-bool</span> FALSE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then I ran:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>defaults <span class="nt">-currentHost</span> write <span class="nt">-globalDomain</span> AppleFontSmoothing <span class="nt">-int</span> 3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Log out, and log back in.</p>

<p>If this worked, great; if not, you can try these options below. My setup is still not perfect (some apps are still weird, as in some websites show really thin fonts), but I can live with what I have. You might have to play around with a few different combinations.  I really hope <a href="https://apple.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a> addresses this in the near future, itâ€™s become really annoying.</p>

<hr />
<p>I had issues with my text editor fonts. I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VSCode</a> and the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IntelliJ IDEA</a>â€™s IDEâ€™sâ€“mostly (sometimes <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sublime Text</a>), and my <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VSCode</a> fonts were thinner than normal. To fix those, I had to run these four commands in my terminal. Note that the trailing <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> can be changed to either <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code> depending on the thickness you are looking for.</p>

<h3 id="vscode-commands">VSCode Commands:</h3>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Terminal:</span>
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled 0
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode.helper CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled 0
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode.helper.EH CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled 0
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode.helper.NP CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled 0
</code></pre></div></div>
<hr />
<p>If you want to change the smoothing thickness of the fonts globally, you can do so with one of these commands; depending on the number you want:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> - <strong>Light</strong> font smoothing</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>defaults <span class="nt">-currentHost</span> write <span class="nt">-globalDomain</span> AppleFontSmoothing <span class="nt">-int</span> 1
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code> - <strong>Medium</strong> font smoothing</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>defaults <span class="nt">-currentHost</span> write <span class="nt">-globalDomain</span> AppleFontSmoothing <span class="nt">-int</span> 2
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code> - <strong>Strong</strong> font smoothing</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>defaults <span class="nt">-currentHost</span> write <span class="nt">-globalDomain</span> AppleFontSmoothing <span class="nt">-int</span> 3
</code></pre></div></div>
<div id="revert"></div>
<hr />

<h3 id="if-you-messed-everything-up">If you messed everything up:</h3>
<p>No need to worry you can set everything back to itâ€™s default OSX Catalina state:</p>

<p><strong>Removes custom font smoothing:</strong></p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>defaults <span class="nt">-currentHost</span> delete <span class="nt">-globalDomain</span> AppleFontSmoothing
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Puts it back to light font smoothing:</strong></p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>defaults write <span class="nt">-g</span> CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled <span class="nt">-bool</span> True
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Iâ€™m yet to find a fix for the IntelliJ IDEâ€™s. I know it would be similar to the VSCode snippets but I havenâ€™t found one that works yet. If you know, please contact me or let me know in the comments so that I can include those. Also, if you have any more info, Iâ€™m happy to work with you to post those on this page.  Hope this helps some of you!</p>

<p>Happy Coding!!!! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
