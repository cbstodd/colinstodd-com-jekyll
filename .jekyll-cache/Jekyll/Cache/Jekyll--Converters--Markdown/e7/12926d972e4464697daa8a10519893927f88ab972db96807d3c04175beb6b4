I"x<p>For just about all of my <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular</a> applications I’ve used <a href="https://realfavicongenerator.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Real Favicon Generator (RFG)</a> to generate the files for my Favicon icon. It’s a great tool, and I highly suggest using it and donating to it. However, their guide only shows you how to add your favicon to a Node or HTML5 application/site. If you are using Angular there are a few more steps involved, so I’ve found a quick and painless way to use both the Node and HTML5 tools. I’ll also show you how to add <a href="https://medium.com/@amberleyjohanna/seriously-though-what-is-a-progressive-web-app-56130600a093" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Progressive Web App (PWA)</a> meta tags so that you can add your newly created icons to your mobile home-screen. Lets get to it.</p>
