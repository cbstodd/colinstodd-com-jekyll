<p class="blurb"><i class="fad fa-bullhorn fa-lg text-yellow"></i><span class="text-yellow"> &nbsp;Update:  </span> I originally wrote this post with hopes of being able to provide you with the link to check if your information had been breeched, but I, like everyone else cannot provide a link.</p>

<p>I find it extremely frustrating when bloggers and companies write posts about these hacks but provide you with zero sort of help.  I wont waste more of your time, but I finally found out that the list was only accessible if you paid to view it. However, a user made the list publicly available which is why there's an uproar from planet Earth. I'm not sure why other sites wont tell you this, I guess they just like the clickbait effect. </p>


<p>As a developer I'll see if someone posts something within the development community, but until then please be sure to go to Facebook and do a checkup on your privacy using the links below. Or you can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/930396167085762" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="How to delete everything Facebook knows about you.">delete everything Facebook knows about you</a>; but keep in mind that you will no longer have a Facebook account, so if you care about your personal photos, and contacts/friends then you might want to simply deactivate your account so that you can download your data at another time, and then delete the account.</p>
