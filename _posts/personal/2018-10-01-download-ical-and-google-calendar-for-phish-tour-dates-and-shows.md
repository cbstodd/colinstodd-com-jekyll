  <i class="fad fa-microphone-stand" style="font-size:3rem;"></i>  UPDATE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fad fa-calendar-alt"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;{{ page.last_modified_at | date_to_string }}<br/>
  <hr/>

  <p class="text-yellow">
    Exactly 25 years after the audience tied the band 1-1 in a chess rivalry, Phish challenges YOU to a rematch as part of a special New Year‚Äôs Eve Dinner And A Movie. We‚Äôll be presenting Phish‚Äôs first New Year‚Äôs Eve show from Madison Square Garden -- 12/31/95 -- in its entirety, beginning at 8:30 pm ET at webcast.livephish.com.
  </p>

  <p class="text-yellow">
    We‚Äôve teamed up with the fine folks at Chess.com to host the Band vs. Audience online chess game which will start right at the top of the show and move at a decent clip. In short, fans will have 5 minutes to move their piece (the band will have no more than that as well). At the end of 5 minutes, whichever move has the most votes is the ‚Äòaudience‚Äô move. Stick around during the set breaks as the band joins in from their various homes, playing a few moves and providing scintillating commentary on the game.
  </p>

  <p class="text-yellow">To join the audience in voting for moves against the band, you will first need to become a member of Chess.com. It is free and you can register at https://www.chess.com/register. After you verify your account by email, join the official club for the audience side at http://bit.ly/2Jry4pG. We will post and send out the actual game link on 12/31.</p>



  <p class="text-yellow">To pace yourself over a long evening, we present some chess cheese board recipes for extended grazing. Our friend Marissa Mullen put together two options ‚Äî ‚ÄúOlive Cheese Dreams‚Äù and ‚ÄúBilly Bries‚Äù ‚Äî with an easy ‚Äòcheese by numbers‚Äô guide. Feel free to swap out any of the ingredients if there‚Äôs something else you prefer. Pair with the bubbly of your choice. For dessert, chessboard cookies! Recipes are at http://livephi.sh/chessmenu.</p>


  <p class="text-yellow">  For this final webcast of the year, our beneficiary will be none other than The WaterWheel Foundation itself. Since 1997, the band and their fans have collaborated on a nationwide charitable endeavor by raising funds and donating the proceeds across the country.  This year alone, collectively we have raised and donated nearly $750,000 to 27 different nonprofits during the Dinner And A Movie series. Join us in continuing to support those in need. Donate at http://www.phish.com/waterwheel.</p>

<span class="">"Due to the ongoing pandemic, we sadly have made the difficult decision to reschedule Phish‚Äôs entire 2020 summer tour, now moving to the summer of 2021. We‚Äôve been as excited as ever to play music for you all, and are so heartbroken to postpone these dates..."</span> <br>

I was unable to find an updated <a href="https://phish.com/tours" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Phish Tour">Phish</a> iCal calendar on the web, so I created one myself and I'm sharing it with you. All you need to do is copy and paste this link into your calendar application.



## Examples:
<h4 class="text-yellow"><i class="fab fa-apple"></i> Calendar (Apple/iCal):</h4>Go in iCalendar and click `File > New Calendar Subscription` and paste the link below into that input field.

**Public <i class="fab fa-apple text-yellow"></i> iCal URL:**
<input type="text" value="{{ page.ical_link }}" id="calendarLink" class="fixed-font">
<p>
  <button onclick="appleFunction()" class="button small">
    <i class="fab fa-apple"></i> Copy URL
  </button>
</p>

<h4 class="text-yellow"><i class="fab fa-google"></i> Google Calendar:</h4>Go into <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Click to open Google Calendar">Google Calendar</a>, on the bottom left hand side you'll see `Other Calendars` then click the <i class="fal fa-plus neu-text"></i> and <br/>select `From URL` and paste the URL below into that input.


**Public <i class="fab fa-google text-yellow"></i> Google URL:**
<input type="text" value="{{ page.gcal_link }}" id="googleCalendarLink" class="fixed-font">
<p>
  <button onclick="googleFunction()" class="button small">
    <i class="fab fa-google"></i> Copy URL
  </button>

You should now see the show dates with details populate on your calendar. I will try and keep this calendar updated should they add more dates. If you see something missing or off, please let me know in the comments.
