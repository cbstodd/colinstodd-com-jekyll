UPDATE:

This calendar has been updated for the 2019 "Fall Tour Dates" and the New Years Run.

There is a two hour alert prior to when the lot opens (if one is specified),
otherwise, times are set to when the doors open. Check each event detail for door and
show times.
```


I was unable to find an updated iCal calendar on the web, so I created one myself and I'm sharing it with you. All you need to do is copy and paste this link into your calendar application. For example, from a MAC, go in iCalendar and click ***File > New Calendar Subscription*** and paste this link into that input field:

**Public Calendar link:**

```
https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/cigokdh5l6cs8i0ph6srjiboig%40group.calendar.google.com/private-65ee2a07a45e7f416407f9d73caa1735/basic.ics
```

You should now see the show dates with details populate on your calendar. I will try and keep this calendar updated should they add more dates this year. If you see something missing or off, please let me know in the comments.
