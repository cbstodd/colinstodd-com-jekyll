For building web applications, I think JetBrain's products are the best you can get. When building JavaScript apps, Webstorm is just that. It may not be light on resources like Sublime or VS Code, but the refactoring and tooling sets it apart from the other editors and IDE's. You will have to pay for the software (free trials), but if you force yourself to learn the tooling, it can be a lifesaver when scaffolding and debugging applications, and is money well spent! I still haven't scratched the surface of what it can do, but here is another video that can help with your ng and JS development.
