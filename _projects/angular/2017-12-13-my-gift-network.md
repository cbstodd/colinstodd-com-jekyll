This is my latest pride and joy as a PWA (Progressive Web Application). It's a gift wishlist slanted as a social network. As of now it's not a store, rather, a fancy gift-list creator. It's still in it's infancy but I feel it's reached it's MVP level, and I plan to incorporate popular online store API's, features, and possibly a browser extension.

The app was built with Angular 5, Bootstrap 4.beta, Firebase (AngularFire API), Angular Material Design, and is hosted on Google's Cloud Platform via Firebase Hosting.
