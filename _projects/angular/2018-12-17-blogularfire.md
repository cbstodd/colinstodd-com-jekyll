I am currently building (and writing this on) my custom built blogging CMS. I plan to make this open source with a paid service for companies to use. It's a bare-bones CMS that covers the basics of simple bloggers' needs. And since it's built with Firebase, the overhead costs will be minimal. The repo is currently private, but I plan to open the source code when I feel good about it being a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage. Please email me if you would like more details.
