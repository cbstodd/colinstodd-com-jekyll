If you landed on this page I assume you have some interest in who I am. And since I'm not cool enough (yet) to have my own Wikipedia page, I'll share this bit on my personal site. In short, Iâ€™m a percussion player turned web application developer. In 2014 I moved from my hometown of Annapolis Maryland to work in the D.C. area with the <a href="https://www.gastro.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Gastroenterological Association</a>.
</p>
<p>
Other than writing software, my other passion in life is music. I played percussion with two bands ("<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/dead-city-radio/346165288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earthtone</a>" and "<a href="https://damnrightmusic.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Damn Right!</a>") for about 10 years; but I knew I wanted more in life so I took a job with the <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frm1st.aspx?tab=home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland General Assembly</a> in Annapolis, MD. While working at the MGA I began teaching myself to program using online resources, but I decided to get a more 'formal' education, Which led me to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails</a>. In August of 2014 I completed a back-end development course at <a href="https://betamore.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betamore Academy</a> in Baltimore Maryland which helped me get to where I am today.
</p>



<p>
Nowadays, I spend most of my time working with the "Full Stack", with a focus on front-end technologies such as <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeScript</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NodeJS</a>. I almost always use a CSS library like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bootstrap</a>, and I've been dabbling into the mobile world via <a href="https://dart.dev/" target="blank" rel="noopener">Dart</a>/<a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flutter</a> and <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ionic</a>.  I guess you could say my stack of choice has become "AngularFlutterFire".

<p>I've recently (2019) been recording percussion tracks on albums/EP's which has me back in the world of music; But for the time being, I'm staying away from live performances opting for the comfort of my <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logic Pro X</a> Studio ðŸ˜ƒ.</p>

<p>
Lastly, If you see some "H" logo, that's the logo for <a href="https://harpua.co/" target="_blank" title="Harpua, LLC" rel="noopener">Harpua, LLC</a> which I co-founded with a great developer friend of mine, and if you see something with "Colper", that's a nickname that I've had since I was young...
