If you landed on this page I assume you have some interest in who I am. And since I'm not cool enough (yet) to have my own Wikipedia page, I'll share this bit on my personal site. In short, Iâ€™m a percussion player turned web application developer. In 2014 I moved from my hometown of Annapolis Maryland to work in the D.C. area with the <a href="https://www.gastro.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Gastroenterological Association</a>.

Other than writing software, my other passion in life is music. I played music with two bands ("<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/dead-city-radio/346165288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earthtone</a>" and "<a href="https://damnrightmusic.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Damn Right!</a>") for about 10 years. I wanted more stability in my life so I took a job with the <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frm1st.aspx?tab=home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland General Assembly</a>. While working at the MGA I began teaching myself to program using online resources, but I quickly realized that I was in-over-my-head and decided to get some formal education; Which led me to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails</a>. In August of 2014 I completed a boot camp course at <a href="https://betamore.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betamore Academy</a> in Baltimore Maryland which helped me land my first development job with the AGA.

<p>
Nowadays, I spend most of my time working with the "Full Stack", with a focus on front-end frameworks such as <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular</a>, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NodeJS</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ExpressJS</a> and much of the common tooling out there for NodeJS; and I almost always use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bootstrap</a> as my foundation.

<p>
If you see some "H" logo, that's the logo for <a href="https://harpua.co/" target="_blank" title="Harpua, LLC" rel="noopener">Harpua, LLC</a>, which I co-founded with a great developer friend of mine. If you see something with "Colper", that's a nickname that I've had since I was young and is the logo used on this site (in the top left menu bar)...
