</span>This site was created primarily for my career in Software Development, but since you're here I assume you have some interest in who I am... In short, Iâ€™m a percussion player turned web application & mobile developer.
</p>

<p>
Other than writing software my other passion in life is music. I played percussion with two bands: <a href="https://damnrightmusic.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Damn Right!</a> and <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/dead-city-radio/346165288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earthtone</a> for about 10 years. However, I wanted to do more than music, so I started my "working" career at the <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frm1st.aspx?tab=home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland General Assembly (MGA)</a> in Annapolis, MD.
</p>

<p>
While working at the MGA I began teaching myself to program using online resources, but I decided to get a "formal" education, which led me to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails</a>. In August of 2014, I completed a back-end development course at <a href="https://betamore.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betamore Academy</a> in Baltimore Maryland which helped me get to where I am today.</p>

<p>In 2014 I moved from my hometown of Annapolis Maryland to work in the D.C. area with the <a href="https://www.gastro.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Gastroenterological Association (AGA)</a>.</p>
<p>
Nowadays, I'm back in Annapolis (still with <a href="https://www.gastro.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AGA</a>), but I spend most of my time working with the "Full Stack", focusing on front-end technologies such as <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeScript</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NodeJS</a>. I almost always use a CSS library like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bootstrap</a>, and I've been dabbling into the mobile world via <a href="https://dart.dev/" target="blank" rel="noopener">Dart</a>/<a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flutter</a> and <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ionic</a>. Working with Angular, Flutter and Firebase allows me to build nearly anything at an extremely cost-effective and scalable manner.
</p>

<p>You can view a list of the programming languages, frameworks, and libraries I work with by visiting my <a href="/technologies.html">Technologies page</a>. </p>

</span>
<p>I've recently (2019-2020) been recording percussion on albums & Experimental Projects (EP's) which has me back in the world of music; But for the time being I'm staying away from live performances opting for the comfort of my <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logic Pro X</a> Studio ðŸ˜ƒ.</p>

<p>
Lastly, If you see some "H" logo, that's the logo for <a href="https://harpua.co/" target="_blank" title="Harpua, LLC" rel="noopener">Harpua, LLC</a> which I co-founded with a great developer friend of mine. If you see something with "Colper", that's a nickname that I've had since I was young, and last but not least, I'm a huge <a href="https://phish.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopner" title="Phish">Phish</a> fan. I travel a few times a year with friends to see them in various locations in and around the United States...
